# GHGfromFADN: GHG emissions from FADN data

GHGfromFADN is an R library to estimate GHG emissions from the main productions of the FADN data (Farm Accountancy Data Network). 

Emissions are expressed in kgCO2eq for each production at the farm level. For now, only main field crop productions and no animal products are included.
